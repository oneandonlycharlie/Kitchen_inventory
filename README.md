# Charlie's Kitchen

## Overview
A website build with full stack using React, Express and PostgreSQL.


**Inspirations:** 

I really would like to create something that I can use day-to-day with the tech skills I have learned so far.

Drawing inspiration from a [local resutrant](https://deboterhal.nl/), I created a digital kitchen inventory for myself where I can keep track and update all of my reciepes.

It becomes super handy when I plan my meal prep or when I make a menu for my guests.
